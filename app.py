            As a big fan of Franchise Cricket, it always bothered me how much attention the Indian Premier League (IPL) gets, compared to other leagues.
             
            So, I've created this web app to blend my passion for Cricket with Data Engineering.
             
            Here, you can stay updated on news, podcasts, standings, and squads (comming up) from Franchise Cricket leagues around the world.

            Plus, building this app has helped me learn some Data Engineering tools and techniques along the way.""")
